Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repository using a site like Github allows you to share your work with others, as well as access to your work from different computers, and a visual interface.

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You should want to review any changes to the repository before accepting them locally as well, since pulling will update the branch you pull into.

Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork allows you essentially clone someone else's work onto your Github account with the added benefit of giving them credit and tracking data. A clone is copying someone's work onto your git workspace. Commits operate on branches, they are the structure of your changes (comits).
