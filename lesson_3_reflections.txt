Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repository using a site like Github allows you to share your work with others, as well as access to your work from different computers, and a visual interface.

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You should want to review any changes to the repository before accepting them locally as well, since pulling will update the branch you pull into.
